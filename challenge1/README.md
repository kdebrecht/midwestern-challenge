#Challenge 1

This challenge has been completed.  I converted the images to HTML and NextJS/React code.  Since my first commit, I have updated the form to post to the midwestern api and get an ID.
ID: 124,125 were from development.

##Thoughts
I seperated out a couple of components
The style sheets are a bit messy, but easy to follow
Comments are lacking in this project
